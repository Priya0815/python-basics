    "# Question 1:\n",
    "Ans: Deque in python , it is a odule collection . Deque is preferred over a list in the cases where we need quicker append and pop operations from both the ends of the container . Queue id linear data sturcture , follows first in first out , orderly and subsequential manner . It is helpful when you want to get things out of the lists in the order that you put in . e.g. In railway reservation customer get services according to the time of booking if the customer is late then they get services late or there is a no service."

    "# Question 2:\n",
    "Ans: Stack is also a linear data sturcture  which works on a principle last in first out . This means the last element inserted in the stack is removed first . The simplest example of stack is like the undo function in browser which we visit recently we can undo."

    "# Question 3:\n",
    "Ans: Sets are unordered collection of data items that store multiple items in a simple variable . Sets items are separated by comma , and enclosed with curly brackets . It is immutable . sets only store unique elements in data so there is efficient work where the duplicate value is not required . Sets are dynamic so there is no error of overflowing pf the sets. Sets improves perfomance in variuos data analysis algorithm."

    "# Question 4:\n",
    "Ans: An array is special variable , which can hold more than one value at a time . An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by referring to an index number . Array in python can be imported by array module . Insert is used to insert value in the array . The advantage of array is it can hold multiple values in a single variable and also helps you to reduce the overall size of the code . It saves time."

    "# Question 5:\n",
    "Ans: list is the ordered collection of data on the other hand dictionaries is unordered collection of data . list uses [] brackets and dictionaries uses {} brackets . it can be access by index and dic is accessed by its keys. list allow duplicate and does not allow duplicate . they both have crucial impact on programming . list can store and data type but dic only store immutable data types . the sorting of list is more easy like ascending and desecending operation because there are sequence but in dic there we can not do sorting because there are no seq "
